# ChatBot_For_Website

project involves creating a chatbot that can answer questions by retrieving information from various online sources
Import Necessary Libraries:

You import several Python libraries and packages, including langchain, faiss, openai, and others, to assist in different aspects of your project.
Document Retrieval:

You start by loading data from various URLs using the UnstructuredURLLoader from the langchain library. This data likely includes text from web pages.
Text Processing:

You use a CharacterTextSplitter to split the retrieved text into smaller chunks or documents for further processing. This helps in organizing and analyzing the text efficiently.
Vectorization and Indexing:

You utilize the FAISS library to create a vector store from the processed documents. This involves converting text data into numerical vectors and organizing them in a way that allows for fast similarity searches.
Question Answering:

You employ a question-answering chain (RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain) to answer questions. It seems that this chain uses the previously created vector store to retrieve relevant information from the processed documents based on user questions.
Output Formatting:

After answering a question, you format the answer and sources for output.
Printing the Results:

In your provided code, you print the answer and sources, which are fetched as a dictionary containing the answer and its sources.
